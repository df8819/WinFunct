# WinFunct App

Random utility app for Windows with functions, scripts and options that have kinda annoyed me to search for or execute separately every damn time I need them ü§≠üôà

### ***This is more of a "learning python/GUI"-repo that will change at will. It provides useful features, but there will probably be bugs or some weird behaviours. Would be cool if a random chad would revamp the whole thing and add features I don't even know yet. Cheers*** üçª
