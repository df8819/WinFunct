## Description / Features

This app combines a lot of useful functions or scripts for managing Windows:

- Extract Wifi passwords, disk speedtest, release/renew DNS, website online checker or logoff users.

- Execute ChrisTitusTech's beloved WinUtils, the MAS script or run a checksum verifier with all encryption algorithms selectable.

- Link opener for a bunch of useful stuff, Win "Godmode" settings, system info extraction/comparison or checking what apps have an active internet connection.

- **Options Tab** is a settings dump for stuff that's usually annoying to find or sort of hidden in Windows.

- **Apps Tab** has some fun stuff like my old python ChatGPT GUI, a hash cracker or a password/passphrase generator 👍

## Comments

- _Thank you for using my App. Feedback is always welcome_ ✌
- _This is my 'learning by doing' app. It provides useful functions, but expect some of them to misbehave or maybe crash from time to time_
