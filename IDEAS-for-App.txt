1. System File Checker (sfc)
    The sfc /scannow command scans and repairs important Windows system files. It's a great tool for troubleshooting and fixing system issues.

2. DiskPart
    DiskPart is a text-mode command interpreter that enables you to manage objects (disks, partitions, or volumes) by using scripts or direct input at a command prompt. It's more advanced and flexible than the Disk Management tool in Windows.

3. DriverQuery
    The driverquery command displays a list of all installed device drivers and their properties. Useful for diagnostics and seeing what drivers are present on a system.

4. Check Disk (chkdsk)
    chkdsk checks the file system and file system metadata of a volume for logical and physical errors. It's a crucial tool for disk diagnostics and repairs.

5. PathPing
    pathping is a network utility that provides information about network latency and network loss at intermediate hops between a source and destination. It's a combination of ping and tracert.

6. Cipher
    cipher is used to encrypt or decrypt files and directories on NTFS volumes. It's also useful for wiping deleted data on a drive by overwriting it.

7. Power Configuration (powercfg)
    powercfg allows you to control power settings and configure power plans. It's particularly useful for laptops and optimizing battery usage. For example, powercfg /batteryreport generates a detailed battery usage report.
